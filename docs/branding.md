# Branding Guidelines

## Typography

**Excalifont** is the primary typeface for this project. It provides a hand-drawn, approachable aesthetic that aligns with the learning-focused nature of the application.

- **Font Family**: `Excalifont`
- **Fallback**: `sans-serif`
- **Usage**: Headings, body text, and UI elements.

## Visual Style

The design should be **clean, clarity-focused, and interactive**.

- **Aesthetic**: Modern, "sketchy" but polished (inspired by Excalidraw).
- **Goal**: Minimize cognitive load; visuals should directly support algorithm understanding.
- **Components**: Use `shadcn/ui` for a consistent, professional foundation, customized to fit the Excalifont vibe.

## UI/UX Principles

- **Consistency**: Every algorithm page follows a strict "Page Contract" (Canvas, Inputs, Controls, State).
- **Legibility**: High contrast, clear hierarchy.
- **Interactivity**: Controls should explain themselves. "Run", "Pause", "Step" should provide immediate visual feedback on the canvas.
