# Branding Guidelines

## Typography

**Excalifont** is the primary typeface for this project. It provides a hand-drawn, approachable aesthetic that aligns with the learning-focused nature of the application.

- **Font Family**: `Excalifont`
- **Fallback**: `sans-serif`
- **Usage**: Headings, body text, and UI elements.

## Identity

**Google Developer Groups on Campus - University of San Carlos (GDG-USC)**

- **Logo**: Official GDG Logo used in footer.
- **Colors**: Core Google Brand colors (Blue, Red, Yellow, Green) used dynamically across categories.
- **Footer**: "Made with love by the GDG-USC Community" (Hyperlinked to GitHub).

## Visual Style

The design should be **clean, clarity-focused, and interactive**.

- **Aesthetic**: Modern, "sketchy" but polished (Glassmorphism + Excalifont).
- **Hero Section**: Features a multi-color gradient text (Blue -> Red -> Yellow -> Green) for specific branding elements, while keeping the main title solid for readability.
- **Categories**: Each algorithm category is color-coded to one of the 4 Google colors.
- **Components**: Use `shadcn/ui` customized with GDG colors.

## UI/UX Principles

- **Consistency**: Every algorithm page follows a strict "Page Contract" (Canvas, Inputs, Controls, State).
- **Legibility**: High contrast, clear hierarchy.
- **Interactivity**: Controls should explain themselves. "Run", "Pause", "Step" should provide immediate visual feedback on the canvas.
